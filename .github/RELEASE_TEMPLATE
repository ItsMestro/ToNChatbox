Make sure you have [ToNSaveManager](https://github.com/ChrisFeline/ToNSaveManager) installed and set up with the following options enabled:

- `WebSocket API Server`
- `Live Tracker Compatability` (Optional) - Enables the fog terror estimation.

Just download the `ToNChatbox.exe` file and place it anywhere, then run it.

There's currently no GUI or other settings but a console with some basic output is displayed while running. Program will automatically close when `ToN Save Manager` is closed.
